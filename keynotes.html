His primary research incorporates several aspects of bioinformatics, metagenomics, computational genomics, and computer architecture. Dr. Alser is particularly interested in rethinking the complete compute stack, starting from the way input data and algorithms are handled, to the underlying hardware architecture for efficiently analyzing genomic data on existing and unconventional (e.g., non-von Neumann) computing technologies. He focuses on incorporating efficient genomic analyses into clinical practice for rapid surveillance of disease outbreaks, diagnosis of genetic disorders, and identification of pathogens and microbiomes around us. Dr. Alser is interested in transforming ideas into innovation and providing consultation services to companies and communities. He closely advises and mentors several graduate and undergraduate students (>40 overall) at ETH Zürich, CMU, and Bilkent University.

His research primarily focuses on the development of new methods for genetic analysis using novel sequencing types, with a specific emphasis on de novo assembly and the detection of structural variation (SV). Dr. Chaisson's expertise in computer science and bioinformatics was developed during his training with Dr. Pavel Pevzner at the University of California, San Diego. He also received training in genetics from Dr. Evan Eichler at the University of Washington. During his PhD studies, Dr. Chaisson developed the first de Bruijn assembler for short-read data, which became the dominant paradigm for short-read assembly. Following this, he worked at Pacific Biosciences, where he developed and published the first method for rapidly aligning long, noisy single-molecule sequencing (SMS) reads. As a postdoctoral scholar, Dr. Chaisson's work focused on the detection of human SV using SMS, which demonstrated that an order of magnitude more variation may be detected using this approach than with typical short-read-based studies. Dr. Chaisson's research in SV has continued with the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC), where he led research cataloging SV in three trios of diverse descent using a set of six diverse sequencing platforms. This consortium comprises over 80 researchers worldwide, and Dr. Chaisson's role in organizing such an effort makes him uniquely suited to continue this research while starting his independent research program at the University of Southern California.
