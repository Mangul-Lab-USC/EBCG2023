Since her PhD, she has been involved in deciphering the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) diversity in health and pathology with a major focus on T-cell biology. From sample to statistical modelling, she is interested in (i) refining T cell differentiation and selection knowledge in health and disease and (ii) identifying biomarkers of diseases. Her main field of research in immunology focus on the study of autoimmune in inflammatory diseases. T-cells and the T-cell receptor being a part of a whole in T-cell biology, she uses the Systems Immunology approach to better characterize the immune system by coordinating the integration of multi-scale biological (deep cell phenotype, transcriptome, repertoire, microbiome) and clinical information. As an Associate Professor, she launched the “Integrative and Systems Immunology” Master 2 curriculum at Sorbonne Université in 2019, with the aim to promote and train the future research generation to Systems Immunology as a whole, including AIRR.

<p>Mark Chaisson is an assistant professor at the Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Southern California. His research primarily focuses on the development of new methods for genetic analysis using novel sequencing types, with a specific emphasis on de novo assembly and the detection of structural variation (SV). Dr. Chaisson's expertise in computer science and bioinformatics was developed during his training with Dr. Pavel Pevzner at the University of California, San Diego. He also received training in genetics from Dr. Evan Eichler at the University of Washington. During his PhD studies, Dr. Chaisson developed the first de Bruijn assembler for short-read data, which became the dominant paradigm for short-read assembly. Following this, he worked at Pacific Biosciences, where he developed and published the first method for rapidly aligning long, noisy single-molecule sequencing (SMS) reads. As a postdoctoral scholar, Dr. Chaisson's work focused on the detection of human SV using SMS, which demonstrated that an order of magnitude more variation may be detected using this approach than with typical short-read-based studies. Dr. Chaisson's research in SV has continued with the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC), where he led research cataloging SV in three trios of diverse descent using a set of six diverse sequencing platforms. This consortium comprises over 80 researchers worldwide, and Dr. Chaisson's role in organizing such an effort makes him uniquely suited to continue this research while starting his independent research program at the University of Southern California.</p></div></div>
