<p>We are delighted to extend an invitation to students and interested individuals to join us for the second edition of the East European Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics School (EEBG). This year's event promises to be an exceptional in-person and virtual learning opportunity, running from June 26 to July 7. Designed specifically for students and researchers in the early stages of their careers in Eastern Europe, EEBG2023 School will provide a comprehensive exploration of bioinformatics and computational biology. We have a fantastic lineup of speakers, including scientists from the top universities in the United States, Switzerland, Denmark, Turkey, Poland, and Romania, who will deliver a range of lectures, keynote presentations, and hands-on sessions. In addition, we are thrilled to announce that the Executive Editor of GigaScience journal will be joining us to give a keynote presentation. GigaScience is an open access, open data, open peer-review journal that focuses on 'big data' research from the life and biomedical sciences. <b>Participants can choose to attend in person or remotely, and we are pleased to offer a limited number of travel fellowships for those who choose to attend in person.</b> If you are interested in applying for a travel fellowship or registering for the event, please visit our website at <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/EEBG2023/registration">https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/EEBG2023/registration</a>. Don't miss this opportunity to engage with leading experts in bioinformatics and computational biology and to broaden your knowledge in these emerging fields.
<p>We are excited to announce that upon completion of the program, a Certificate in Bioinformatics will be offered to individuals who attend all lectures and successfully complete an individual project. This certificate will serve as recognition of the skills and knowledge gained through participation in the East European Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics School (EEBG).</p>
<p>Our mission is to train future bioinformatics experts and create an Eastern European bioinformatics hub to develop and promote bioinformatics knowledge and skills in the field of computational medicine and biomedical data science.</p>
<p><b>The objective of this course is to train students in the state of the art tools and methods for reproducible, rigorous, and reproducible biomedical data analysis, including methods to visualize display data and perform appropriate statistical analysis. Students are expected to learn how to:</b></p><ul><li>Analyze the large-scale biomedical data using commonly used interactive python-based libraries and packages.</li><li>Use various visualizations techniques to display real-world biomedical data in real-time.</li><li>Select the most appropriate statistical methods and apply it to real word biomedical data.</li><li>Use version control and public repositories for transparent and reproducible data analysis.</li><li>Write the data analysis component of a scientific manuscript and create an easy-to-navigate publicly shared repository with code and analysis accompanying the scientific manuscript.</li><li>Prepare the “Code availability” and “Data availability” statements to make materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available to readers as now required by a large number of scientific journals (e.g. Nature journals).</li><li>Run bioinformatics tools on the High Performance Clusters with use of Unix based pipelines.</li><li>Understand the advantages and weaknesses, and application of major sequencing technologies and existing bioinformatics tools.</li><li>Be able to participate in real world scientific projects by making contributions with data analysis and interpretation.</li></ul><p>EEBG2023 is an initiative of the Bioinformatics Laboratory of Technical University of Moldova (Chișinău, Moldova) and the Mangul Lab at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy (Los Angeles, California, USA), supported by BioTech Association from Moldova, USAID, and Sweden.</p>
